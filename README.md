## Katamari-DamaSEA-hack
Is developed by a professional retard (me). I spent 3 hours trying to get the Timer set function to work when one of my offsets had a I in it that needed to be a 1.<br>
Anyway, I dont recommend you to use this hack but rather study its code and what not. This project was just a learning expierence for me its not supposed to be anything special.
